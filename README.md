### Installation

Installing FloatingTools is intended to be very simple as to allow for less technical people to set up.

1. Download the release you would like to use from [here](https://github.com/aldmbmtl/FloatingTools/releases). 
Usually the latest is fine. If you are on Linux, download the .tar. The .zip will be fine for all other operating systems. 

2. After downloading and unpacking the .zip or .tar, open the directory and copy the FloatingTools folder 
(this is the python package) and put it on your python sys.path. If you are in Nuke for example, your .nuke directory is
 fine. This package is set up for individual use and studio use. For studio installs, you can store this in a server
 location and it will work the same.
   
3. Simply import FloatingTools and it will make you log in to your github account. You're done!
